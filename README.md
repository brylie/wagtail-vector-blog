# Wagtail Vector Search Blog Project Overview

This project aims to create a simple blog using Wagtail CMS with integrated vector search capabilities. The blog posts will be automatically embedded in a vector database when created or edited, allowing for efficient semantic search functionality.

## Architecture

### 1. Core Components

- Wagtail CMS: Provides the content management system for creating and managing blog posts.
- Django: The web framework underlying Wagtail.
- PostgreSQL: The primary database for storing blog content and metadata.
- pgvector: PostgreSQL extension for vector similarity search.
- Wagtail Vector Search: A plugin to integrate vector search capabilities with Wagtail.

### 2. Data Flow

1. Content Creation/Editing:
   - Authors create or edit blog posts using the Wagtail admin interface.
   - On save, the blog post content is processed to create vector embeddings.
   - The embeddings are stored in the vector database (PostgreSQL with pgvector).

2. Search:
   - Users enter search queries on the frontend.
   - Queries are converted to vector embeddings.
   - The vector database is searched for similar content.
   - Results are returned and displayed to the user.

### 3. Key Features

- Automatic embedding generation for blog posts.
- Real-time updating of embeddings when content is edited.
- Semantic search capabilities using vector similarity.
- Standard Wagtail CMS features for content management.

### 4. Technical Stack

- Backend: Python, Django, Wagtail
- Database: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Search: Wagtail Vector Search plugin
- Frontend: Wagtail templates (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

### 5. Development Phases

1. Set up basic Wagtail project
2. Integrate PostgreSQL with pgvector
3. Install and configure Wagtail Vector Search plugin
4. Develop blog models and templates
5. Implement vector search functionality
6. Testing and optimization
7. Deployment

## Next Steps

1. Set up the development environment
2. Create a new Wagtail project
3. Configure PostgreSQL with pgvector
4. Install and set up the Wagtail Vector Search plugin
